These gooey cinnamon rolls are even better than Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, and are topped with a delicious cream cheese frosting! They're easy to make and can be prepared the day before and left to rise overnight in the refrigerator.</p>, <p>Whenever I need to make a special breakfast, I always turn to this homemade cinnamon roll recipe. Christmas morning, birthdays, you name it, my family requests that we begin our celebrations with these gooey cinnamon rolls.</p>, <p>This particular cinnamon roll recipe is a step above the rest. With a few special (but not difficult) touches (which we'll discuss below), and an easy-to-follow method, you can make the best cinnamon rolls EVER, in the comfort of your own home!</p>, <p>I can honestly say they are even <em>better</em> than Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, because nothing beats fresh rolls straight from the oven! They are also easy to prepare a day in advance and let them rise overnight in the refrigerator, or they can be prepared a few weeks in advance and frozen!</p>, <p>And we can't forget one of the best parts, these gooey cinnamon rolls are topped with the <em>best</em> cream cheese frosting <em>ever!</em>  Once you make this cinnamon roll recipe it is sure to become your favorite for years to come! So let's get baking!</p>, <p>This recipe took me years to perfect, and as such I do not recommend making any substitutions if you want to make the <em>best cinnamon rolls EVER. </em>These homemade cinnamon rolls contain only a few, common ingredients that most of us always have on hand! Flour, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, cinnamon, etc.</p>, <p><strong>What makes this cinnamon roll recipe stand out among the rest</strong> is that there is both vanilla extract and cinnamon <em>in the cinnamon roll dough. </em>These two additions takes these cinnamon rolls from good, to <em>wow those are great! </em></p>, <p>To help ensure your success in making this Best Cinnamon Rolls Recipe, we are going to walk through every step in the process together, and don't forget to watch the video! Starting with making the cinnamon roll dough.</p>, <p>Just like any yeast dough, start by proofing the yeast until it is foamy. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients stir until they are just combined.</p>, <p>Combine the dry ingredients then add them to the wet ingredients, then stir to combine. </p>, <p>I recommend using a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook to make the dough for these best cinnamon rolls. My only recommendation is to add a about ⅓ of the dry ingredients at a time, mixing after each addition, to avoid making a floury mess!</p>, <p><strong>Mixing the dough by hand: </strong></p>, <p>Mixing the dough by hand is also very easy to do! The only difference will be that mixing the cinnamon roll dough by hand requires more kneading by hand than using the standing mixer.</p>, <p>Once a firm but slightly tacky dough ball has formed in the standing mixer (as pictured below), turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead by hand, adding more flour if necessary.</p>, <p>Knead the dough for 2-5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, but still a little sticky.</p>, <p>Once the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a lightly greased bowl to rise. I recommend covering it with a warm, damp towel and putting the bowl in a warm place to rise (for about 1 hour).</p>, <p>To help the homemade cinnamon roll dough rise faster simply boil some water and put it in a bowl or measuring dish next to the bread that’s rising.</p>, <p>Cover the bread AND the vessel containing the boiling water with a damp towel and let the magic happen! This creates a warm, moist environment that yeast <em>loves. </em></p>, <p>I also recommend putting the dough/boiling water/damp cloth apparatus in your oven with the lights turned on. This creates a warm moist environment that the yeast loves, which speeds up the rising process.</p>, <p>While the homemade cinnamon roll dough is rising, make the cinnamon sugar filling. This is very easy to do, however there are two different methods I would like to discuss...</p>, <p>The second method is easier (in my opinion), because spreading the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture is a touch difficult. However the first method (mixing all the ingredients together) is my preferred method.</p>, <p>I prefer this method because the filling doesn't leak to the bottom of the pan (and out of the cinnamon rolls) as much it does with method #2. There is virtually no filling leakage when all the ingredients are combined and spread onto the dough, but there is some leakage with the melted butter method.</p>, <p>After the dough has risen, press it down to release the air from it and form it into a rectangle. This step is important because it makes it easier to roll the dough into the desired shape (which is a large rectangle)!</p>, <p>Place the dough rectangle onto a well-floured surface and you are all ready for the next step....</p>, <p>Next, roll the cinnamon roll dough rectangle into a 24x12” rectangle that is about ¼\" thick. This dough is so easy to work with that this step should be very easy!</p>, <p>If you find the dough is sticking to the rolling surface, add a light dusting of flour!</p>, <p>I use this<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DtcpYA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> marble rolling pin</a> in every recipe that requires rolling and I absolutely love it. The weight is perfect to get a nice even roll, especially for yeasted dough.</p>, <p>Once the dough has been rolled out into the desired shape and size, add the cinnamon sugar filling. As I mentioned above, spreading the filling can be a little tricky, but here are a few tips to make it easier:</p>, <p>When the filling is evenly spread, it will look like the photo below. <strong>Be sure to leave a ¼\" border around the edges without filling so that it doesn't leak during baking. </strong></p>, <p>It is very important to get a tight roll on the dough. I recommend pulling the dough towards you and gently pressing down as you roll it.</p>, <p>Once you have finished tightly rolling the best cinnamon roll dough, it should look like the photo below. Be sure to <strong>pinch together </strong>the dough where the end meets the roll, to prevent the filling from leaking.</p>, <p>Now it's time to cut these homemade cinnamon rolls into individual pieces. I recommend using a <em>very</em> sharp knife or even a string to cut them, to avoid smushing the rolls and ruining the swirl.</p>, <p>I <em>highly</em> recommend that you do not eyeball the cutting process. Instead, measure the length of the dough roll (which should be 24\" long) and divide it by 12 to determine how long each cinnamon roll should be.</p>, <p>Then, use your knife to make marks at the places you will cut (in the case of a 24\" roll that would be every 2 inches). After you have marked out all of your cuts, <em>then</em> use either a knife or string to cut the rolls.</p>, <p>Arrange the cinnamon rolls into four rows of three in a 9x13\" baking dish. They will rise and touch each other, but this is a <em>good thing </em>(as I will discuss later)!</p>, <p>I recommend lining the baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from sticking to the pan.</p>, <p>I receive many questions about making these in advance. There are many ways to do this, here are my suggestions below. Always tightly cover the rolls so no air can get to the dough and dry it out. </p>, <p>Once the homemade cinnamon rolls are arranged in the baking sheet, cover them with a warm damp towel and let them rise until doubled in size. Be very careful not to let the towel touch the tops of the cinnamon rolls.</p>, <p>During this rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F so the oven is ready to go once the dough has risen (which takes between 30 and 60 minutes). After they have risen, they should look like the photo below.</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">YES! I often make this best cinnamon rolls recipe the night before a special holiday or event (like Christmas, my daughter's birthday, etc.) and let them rise overnight.<br/>However, it is very important that you put the dough in the <strong>refrigerator</strong>. Do not leave them at room temperature overnight, because you run the risk of them rising too much and becoming a big doughy mess.</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">To store the unbaked cinnamon rolls in the refrigerator, wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid. I often use this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FrvtZZ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">glass baking dish with a lid</a>, to ensure that the dough doesn't dry out overnight.</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Yes! I recommend refrigerating the dough after it has been cut, as discussed above.</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">YES! I do this all the time to prepare even farther in advance than the night before. To do this, place the cinnamon roll dough in baking sheet and wrap it as mentioned above (wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid). Then place it in the freezer for up to 1 month (but I don't recommend any longer than 1 month).</p>, <p>After the rolls have doubled in size, it's time to put them in that oven and bake! Something important to note is that this cinnamon rolls recipe <strong>will</strong> <strong>rise more in the oven.</strong> So do not be surprised if you see the rolls start to puff up even more as they bake, that is normal and <em>good.</em></p>, <p>This homemade cinnamon roll recipe bakes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (which is about 177 degrees Celsius). Please do not try to rush the baking process by increasing the temperature. It is important to the final rising process that these rolls bake at 350 degrees F!</p>, <p>Bake this homemade cinnamon roll recipe for 18-20 minutes. You will know the rolls are done when...</p>, <p>Below is a great photo showing how the rolls looked after they have finished baking.</p>, <p>In my opinion, there is no other way to top a cinnamon roll than with a delicious, homemade cream cheese frosting. I recommend making the frosting while the cinnamon rolls are baking!</p>, <p>This cream cheese frosting recipe is my absolute favorite, and I use it on so many recipes (like <a href=\"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/rainbow-fruit-pizza/\">this rainbow fruit pizza</a> and<a href=\"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/healthy-carrot-pineapple-cake/\"> this carrot cake</a> and so much more)!</p>, <p>Here are a few tips for making the cream cheese icing for this Cinnabon cinnamon roll recipe:</p>, <p>As you can see below, the result is an irresistibly creamy and delicious cream cheese icing that truly makes this the best cinnamon rolls recipe EVER!</p>, <p><em>Frost the cinnamon rolls as soon as you remove them from the oven. </em>I cannot stress this enough! Adding the cream cheese frosting to the warm cinnamon rolls is one of the factors that makes this cinnamon roll recipe SO GREAT.</p>, <p>Frosting the cinnamon rolls when they are warm causes the icing to melt into the cracks of the rolls, making every bite full of gooey, frosted deliciousness.</p>, <p>Finally, it is time to dig in and enjoy these homemade cinnamon rolls! I recommend letting them cool for 10 or so minutes before serving. But eating them warm is <em>definitely</em> the best way to enjoy them!</p>, <p>Yes! I have done this <em>many</em> times. Simply flash-freeze the cinnamon rolls on a pan. Once they are frozen, wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and put them in an airtight container in the freezer.</p>, <p>To reheat, either leave them at room temperature until they are soft and then microwave for 25-30 seconds, or use the defrosting setting in your microwave to thaw the cinnamon rolls. They can also be warmed in an oven set to 300 degrees! Just be sure to watch them so the frosting doesn't completely melt!</p>, <p>I just want to take a moment and answer a few more questions about this best cinnamon rolls recipe before we wrap it up and talk about the ingredients!</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">I do not recommend baking these directly from frozen for one very important reason: The dough needs to rise.<br/><br/><strong>To bake cinnamon rolls after the dough has been frozen:</strong><br/>Remove the frozen cinnamon roll dough from the freezer the night before you would like to bake them.<br/>Leave the dough on the counter to come to room temperature and rise until doubled in size.<br/>After the dough has risen, bake and frost according to the recipe instructions.</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">This cinnamon roll recipe makes the absolute best, gooiest cinnamon rolls for the following reasons:<br/><strong>The rolls touch each other while baking. </strong>After the cinnamon rolls rise they will be touching each other on all sides (except for the part pointing to the outside of the pan). This keeps the centers nice and soft and gooey!<br/><strong>The filling doesn't leak out</strong>. Using the method where all the ingredients are mixed together and then spread onto the dough keeps the filling <em>inside</em> the homemade cinnamon rolls where it belongs, which makes them nice and gooey.<br/><strong>Frosting while warm. </strong>Like I explained above, frosting the cinnamon rolls while they are warm makes them extra gooey and delicious!</p>, <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\"><br/>Sometimes things happen during the baking process and the filling leaks out. To get it back into the rolls simply cover the pan of warm rolls with a lid or another baking sheet and invert the baking sheet.<br/>This will cause the filling to drip back into the cinnamon rolls and become nice and gooey again!</p>, <p>We take breakfast seriously!

They are also easy to prepare a day in advance and let them rise overnight in the refrigerator, or they can be prepared a few weeks in advance and frozen!', \"And we can't forget one of the best parts, these gooey cinnamon rolls are topped with the\\xa0best cream cheese frosting\\xa0ever!\\xa0 Once you make this cinnamon roll recipe it is sure to become your favorite for years to come! So let's get baking!\", 'This recipe took me years to perfect, and as such I do not recommend making any substitutions if you want to make the best cinnamon rolls EVER. These homemade cinnamon rolls contain only a few, common ingredients that most of us always have on hand! Flour, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, cinnamon, etc.', 'What makes this cinnamon roll recipe stand out among the rest is that there is both vanilla extract and cinnamon\\xa0in the cinnamon roll dough.\\xa0These two additions takes these cinnamon rolls from good, to\\xa0wow those are great!', \"To help ensure your success in making this Best Cinnamon Rolls Recipe, we are going to walk through every step in the process together, and don't forget to watch the video! Starting with making the cinnamon roll dough.\", 'Just like any yeast dough, start by proofing the yeast until it is foamy. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients stir until they are just combined.', 'Combine the dry ingredients then add them to the wet ingredients, then stir to combine.', 'I recommend using a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook to make the dough for these best cinnamon rolls. My only recommendation is to add a about ⅓ of the dry ingredients at a time, mixing after each addition, to avoid making a floury mess!', 'Mixing the dough by hand:', 'Mixing the dough by hand is also very easy to do! The only difference will be that mixing the cinnamon roll dough by hand requires more kneading by hand than using the standing mixer.', 'Once a firm but slightly tacky dough ball has formed in the standing mixer (as pictured below), turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead by hand, adding more flour if necessary.', 'Knead the dough for 2-5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, but still a little sticky.', 'Once the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a lightly greased bowl to rise. I recommend covering it with a warm, damp towel and putting the bowl in a warm place to rise (for about 1 hour).', 'To help the homemade cinnamon roll dough rise faster simply boil some water and put it in a bowl or measuring dish next to the bread that’s rising.', 'Cover the bread AND the vessel containing the boiling water with a damp towel and let the magic happen! This creates a warm, moist environment that yeast\\xa0loves.', 'I also recommend putting the dough/boiling water/damp cloth apparatus in your oven with the lights turned on. This creates a warm moist environment that the yeast loves, which speeds up the rising process.', 'While the homemade cinnamon roll dough is rising, make the cinnamon sugar filling. This is very easy to do, however there are two different methods I would like to discuss...', 'The second method is easier (in my opinion), because spreading the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture is a touch difficult. However the first method (mixing all the ingredients together) is my preferred method.', \"I prefer this method because the filling doesn't leak to the bottom of the pan (and out of the cinnamon rolls) as much it does with method #2. There is virtually no filling leakage when all the ingredients are combined and spread onto the dough, but there is some leakage with the melted butter method.\", 'After the dough has risen, press it down to release the air from it and form it into a rectangle.\\xa0This step is important because it makes it easier to roll the dough into the desired shape (which is a large rectangle)!', 'Place the dough rectangle onto a well-floured surface and you are all ready for the next step....', 'Next, roll the cinnamon roll dough rectangle into a 24x12” rectangle that is about ¼\" thick. This dough is so easy to work with that this step should be very easy!', 'If you find the dough is sticking to the rolling surface, add a light dusting of flour!', 'I use this marble rolling pin in every recipe that requires rolling and I absolutely love it. The weight is perfect to get a nice even roll, especially for yeasted dough.', 'Once the dough has been rolled out into the desired shape and size, add the cinnamon sugar filling. As I mentioned above, spreading the filling can be a little tricky, but here are a few tips to make it easier:', 'When the filling is evenly spread, it will look like the photo below. Be sure to leave a ¼\" border around the edges without filling so that it doesn\\'t leak during baking.', 'It is very important to get a tight roll on the dough. I recommend pulling the dough towards you and gently pressing down as you roll it.', 'Once you have finished tightly rolling the best cinnamon roll dough, it should look like the photo below. Be sure to\\xa0pinch together\\xa0the dough where the end meets the roll, to prevent the filling from leaking.', \"Now it's time to cut these homemade cinnamon rolls into individual pieces. I recommend using a\\xa0very sharp knife or even a string to cut them, to avoid smushing the rolls and ruining the swirl.\", 'I\\xa0highly recommend that you do not eyeball the cutting process. Instead, measure the length of the dough roll (which should be 24\" long) and divide it by 12 to determine how long each cinnamon roll should be.', 'Then, use your knife to make marks at the places you will cut (in the case of a 24\" roll that would be every 2 inches). After you have marked out all of your cuts,\\xa0then use either a knife or string to cut the rolls.', 'Arrange the cinnamon rolls into four rows of three in a 9x13\" baking dish. They will rise and touch each other, but this is a\\xa0good thing\\xa0(as I will discuss later)!', 'I recommend lining the baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from sticking to the pan.', 'I receive many questions about making these in advance. There are many ways to do this, here are my suggestions below. Always tightly cover the rolls so no air can get to the dough and dry it out.', 'Once the homemade cinnamon rolls are arranged in the baking sheet, cover them with a warm damp towel and let them rise until doubled in size. Be very careful not to let the towel touch the tops of the cinnamon rolls.', 'During this rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F so the oven is ready to go once the dough has risen (which takes between 30 and 60 minutes).\\xa0After they have risen, they should look like the photo below.', \"YES! I often make this best cinnamon rolls recipe the night before a special holiday or event (like Christmas, my daughter's birthday, etc.) and let them rise overnight.However, it is very important that you put the dough in the refrigerator. Do not leave them at room temperature overnight, because you run the risk of them rising too much and becoming a big doughy mess.\", \"To store the unbaked cinnamon rolls in the refrigerator, wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid. I often use this glass baking dish with a lid, to ensure that the dough doesn't dry out overnight.\", 'Yes! I recommend refrigerating the dough after it has been cut, as discussed above.', \"YES! I do this all the time to prepare even farther in advance than the night before. To do this, place the cinnamon roll dough in baking sheet and wrap it as mentioned above (wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid). Then place it in the freezer for up to 1 month (but I don't recommend any longer than 1 month).\", \"After the rolls have doubled in size, it's time to put them in that oven and bake! Something important to note is that this cinnamon rolls recipe will\\xa0rise more in the oven. So do not be surprised if you see the rolls start to puff up even more as they bake, that is normal and\\xa0good.\", 'This homemade cinnamon roll recipe bakes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (which is about 177 degrees Celsius). Please do not try to rush the baking process by increasing the temperature. It is important to the final rising process that these rolls bake at 350 degrees F!', 'Bake this homemade cinnamon roll recipe for 18-20 minutes. You will know the rolls are done when...', 'Below is a great photo showing how the rolls looked after they have finished baking.', 'In my opinion, there is no other way to top a cinnamon roll than with a delicious, homemade cream cheese frosting. I recommend making the frosting while the cinnamon rolls are baking!', 'This cream cheese frosting recipe is my absolute favorite, and I use it on so many recipes (like this rainbow fruit pizza\\xa0and this carrot cake\\xa0and so much more)!', 'Here are a few tips for making the cream cheese icing for this Cinnabon cinnamon roll recipe:', 'As you can see below, the result is an irresistibly creamy and delicious cream cheese icing that truly makes this the best cinnamon rolls recipe EVER!', 'Frost the cinnamon rolls as soon as you remove them from the oven.\\xa0I cannot stress this enough! Adding the cream cheese frosting to the warm cinnamon rolls is one of the factors that makes this cinnamon roll recipe SO GREAT.', 'Frosting the cinnamon rolls when they are warm causes the icing to melt into the cracks of the rolls, making every bite full of gooey, frosted deliciousness.', 'Finally, it is time to dig in and enjoy these homemade cinnamon rolls! I recommend letting them cool for 10 or so minutes before serving. But eating them warm is\\xa0definitely the best way to enjoy them!', 'Yes! I have done this\\xa0many times. Simply flash-freeze the cinnamon rolls on a pan. Once they are frozen, wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and put them in an airtight container in the freezer.', \"To reheat, either leave them at room temperature until they are soft and then microwave for 25-30 seconds, or use the defrosting setting in your microwave to thaw the cinnamon rolls. They can also be warmed in an oven set to 300 degrees! Just be sure to watch them so the frosting doesn't completely melt!\", 'I just want to take a moment and answer a few more questions about this best cinnamon rolls recipe before we wrap it up and talk about the ingredients!', 'I do not recommend baking these directly from frozen for one very important reason: The dough needs to rise.To bake cinnamon rolls after the dough has been frozen:Remove the frozen cinnamon roll dough from the freezer the night before you would like to bake them.Leave the dough on the counter to come to room temperature and rise until doubled in size.After the dough has risen, bake and frost according to the recipe instructions.', \"This cinnamon roll recipe makes the absolute best, gooiest cinnamon rolls for the following reasons:The rolls touch each other while baking.\\xa0After the cinnamon rolls rise they will be touching each other on all sides (except for the part pointing to the outside of the pan). This keeps the centers nice and soft and gooey!The filling doesn't leak out. Using the method where all the ingredients are mixed together and then spread onto the dough keeps the filling\\xa0inside the homemade cinnamon rolls where it belongs, which makes them nice and gooey.Frosting while warm.\\xa0Like I explained above, frosting the cinnamon rolls while they are warm makes them extra gooey and delicious!\", 'Sometimes things happen during the baking process and the filling leaks out. To get it back into the rolls simply cover the pan of warm rolls with a lid or another baking sheet and invert the baking sheet.This will cause the filling to drip back into the cinnamon rolls and become nice and gooey again!', 'We take breakfast seriously!
